9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

#Code
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
word = list()

for line in handle:
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        line = line.split()
        #print(line)
        #print(line[1])
        word.append(line[1])
        #print(word)
        

hold = dict()    
  
for w in word:
    hold[w] = hold.get(w,0) +1
    

bigcount = None
bigword = None
for w,c in hold.items():
    if bigcount is None or c>bigcount:
        bigcount = c
        bigword = w

print(bigword , bigcount)
