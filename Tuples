10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages.
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

word = list()
new_word = list()
newest_word = list()
hold = list()
new_hold = dict()

for line in handle:
    if line.startswith('From'):
        word = line.split()
        if len(word)>5:
            hold = word[5]
        new_word = hold.split(':')
        newest_word=new_word[0]
        new_hold[newest_word] = new_hold.get(newest_word, 0)+1

l = list()
for i,j in new_hold.items():
    l.append((i,j))
    
l.sort()
for v,k in l:
    print(v,int(k/2))
